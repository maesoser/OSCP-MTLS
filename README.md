 # mTLS-OCSP

This is a test script to add an OCSP verification option for mTLS client certificates. It can be attached to Cloudflare proxy endpoints protected by API Shield or Access mTLS with BYO CA.

## Usage

### Forward a client certificate to a Worker

It is to expose a client certificate to a Worker via `cf-client-cert-der-base64` request header.

```
  --data '{
    "settings": [
        {
            "hostname": "<HOSTNAME>",
            "client_certificate_forwarding": true
        }
    ]
}'
```


### Edit wrangler.toml

`vars`: 

`CA_CLIENT_ISSUER` - replace it with your client certificate issuer

`CA_OCSP_ROOT` - replace it with your OCSP responder's issuer

* remove BEGIN/END lines and LF from a PEM
